# PowerPoint data extraction

## Motivation: extract all slide titles and presenter notes from a PPTX file
## E.g. to have them available as a teleprompter text

Steps:

* Install relevant Python 3 module:
```
pip install python-pptx
```

* Run Python script:
```
python3 ./1-extract-presenter-notes.py
```

Apart from slide data extraction, you can even create slides content - see more details here: https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html
